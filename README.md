Codedamn's mission is to make coding highly engaging and interactive - wherever possible. We do this by creating hands-on courses - thanks to our interactive playground that runs in the browser connected to computers in the cloud.
Programming is a healthy mix of learning, practicing, and interacting with others. Unfortunately, existing edtech platforms are not built for self-taught developers because they're not founded by self-taught developers trying to work on real-world tech skills and lack the struggles of becoming one.
We are building the best community of developers and learners on the planet - built by developers and backed by cutting-edge technology.
